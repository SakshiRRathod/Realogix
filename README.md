# Realogix
An intelligent system for real estate pricing analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebooks to predict pricing tiers through classification algorithms.

## Project Overview
The real estate market is a tapestry woven from various factors â€” location, property features, economic conditions, and more. Our mission is to unravel this complexity by creating a model that classifies properties into distinct pricing tiers. This tool empowers decision-making, offering insights that pave the way for a deeper understanding of the market.

Our data is sourced from Kaggle's USA Real Estate Dataset, offering a comprehensive view of the current real estate landscape.

## Classification Criteria for Residential Properties
1. Starter Homes (Tier 1)
Priced below $300,000
Ideal for first-time buyers or those on a budget
Examples: Entry-level homes in suburban areas

2. Family-Friendly Homes (Tier 2)
Priced between $300,001 and $500,000
Offering space and amenities for families
Examples: Single-family homes, townhouses, or condos with multiple bedrooms

4. Executive Properties (Tier 3)
Priced between $500,001 and $1,000,000
Features modern amenities and urban convenience
Examples: Upscale homes and luxury townhouses in desirable neighborhoods

5. Luxury Estates (Tier 4)
Priced above $1,000,000
Expansive living spaces and premium features
Examples: High-end homes with private gyms, swimming pools, and exclusive locations

Addressing imbalanced classes

2.Defining Pricing Tiers
Classifying properties into distinct tiers

3.Encoding Categorical Values
Transforming non-numerical data for algorithm compatibility

4.Feature Selection and Splitting
Identifying relevant features and splitting the dataset

5.Model Training and Evaluation
Testing various algorithms and evaluating their performance

6.Integration and Deployment
Deploying the trained model for user interaction

7.Monitoring
Ensuring ongoing accuracy and relevance of predictions

## Focus Areas
1.Data Quality: Cleaning and handling inconsistencies
